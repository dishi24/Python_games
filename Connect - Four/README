Within connect4.py, the objects that are defined are Game, Player, and AIPlayer. When play.py is executed, an instance of Game is initialized. When the game is initialized, the program asks the user to select a human or computer player for Player 1 (who will be represented in the game with "x") and Player 2 (represented with "o").  For each human player, an instance of Player is initialized and for each computer player, an instance of AIPlayer is initialized.  AIPlayer is a subclass of Player.  When an AIPlayer is initialized, a difficulty value is set represents the level to which the minimax algorithm searches.
